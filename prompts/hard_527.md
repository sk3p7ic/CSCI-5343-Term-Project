Given an array of **distinct** strings `words`, return *the minimal possible **abbreviations** for every word*.


The following are the rules for a string abbreviation:


1. The **initial** abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.
2. If more than one word shares the **same** abbreviation, then perform the following operation:
	* **Increase** the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by `1`.
		+ For example, say you start with the words `["abcdef","abndef"]` both initially abbreviated as `"a4f"`. Then, a sequence of operations would be `["a4f","a4f"]` -> `["ab3f","ab3f"]` -> `["abc2f","abn2f"]`.
	* This operation is repeated until every abbreviation is **unique**.
3. At the end, if an abbreviation did not make a word shorter, then keep it as the original word.


 


**Example 1:**



```
**Input:** words = ["like","god","internal","me","internet","interval","intension","face","intrusion"]
**Output:** ["l2e","god","internal","me","i6t","interval","inte4n","f2e","intr4n"]

```
**Example 2:**



```
**Input:** words = ["aa","aaa"]
**Output:** ["aa","aaa"]

```

 


**Constraints:**


* `1 <= words.length <= 400`
* `2 <= words[i].length <= 400`
* `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* All the strings of `words` are **unique**.
